       "\n",
       "**Event:** A magnitude 6.8 earthquake strikes Los Angeles, California.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Date & Time:** October 26, 2024, 03:45 AM PST\n",
       "\n",
       "**Epicenter:**  Located approximately 8 miles (13 km) northeast of downtown Los Angeles, near the city of Pasadena. This places it directly under a densely populated area.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Geological Context:** The earthquake occurs on a previously unknown fault line, branching off the Sierra Madre Fault Zone. This unexpected rupture contributes to the severity of the damage.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Immediate Impacts:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Shaking Intensity:**  Widespread \"violent\" shaking (MMI VIII-IX) across the Los Angeles Basin, with \"severe\" shaking (MMI VII) felt as far as San Bernardino and Ventura counties.\n",
       "*   **Infrastructure Damage:**\n",
       "    *   **Buildings:** Widespread damage to older, unreinforced masonry buildings.  Modern buildings fare better but still experience significant structural and non-structural damage (broken windows, fallen facades, internal damage).  Some collapses occur, particularly in older residential areas and commercial districts.\n",
       "    *   **Transportation:**  Major freeway overpasses and bridges sustain damage, leading to closures on key arteries like the I-5, I-10, and 101.  Surface streets are blocked by debris and fallen power lines.  Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) experiences runway damage and is temporarily closed.  The Metro Rail system suffers damage, with some sections collapsing.\n",
       "    *   **Utilities:**  Widespread power outages across the city.  Water mains rupture, leading to water shortages and contamination concerns.  Natural gas lines break, causing fires in several neighborhoods.  Cell phone service is overwhelmed and unreliable.\n",
       "*   **Casualties:**\n",
       "    *   **Immediate:**  Significant injuries and fatalities are reported.  Hospitals are overwhelmed with patients.  Many people are trapped in collapsed buildings.\n",
       "    *   **Estimates:** Initial estimates suggest hundreds of fatalities and thousands of injuries, but these numbers are expected to rise as search and rescue efforts progress.\n",
       "*   **Emergency Response:**\n",
       "    *   **Initial Chaos:**  The 911 system is overloaded.  First responders are hampered by damaged infrastructure and blocked roads.\n",
       "    *   **Activation:**  The Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) and Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) activate their emergency response plans.  The National Guard is mobilized.  FEMA is notified and begins preparing to deploy resources.\n",
       "*   **Social Impacts:**\n",
       "    *   **Panic and Fear:**  Widespread panic and fear among the population.  People are trapped in their homes, offices, and vehicles.\n",
       "    *   **Displacement:**  Thousands of people are displaced from their homes due to damage or fear of aftershocks.  Shelters are quickly established but are soon overwhelmed.\n",
       "    *   **Looting and Civil Unrest:**  Reports of looting and civil unrest begin to surface in some areas.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Secondary Impacts:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Aftershocks:**  Numerous aftershocks, some of significant magnitude (5.0+), continue to rattle the region, causing further damage and hindering rescue efforts.\n",
       "*   **Fires:**  Multiple fires break out due to ruptured gas lines and downed power lines.  The LAFD struggles to contain the blazes due to water shortages and blocked roads.\n",
       "*   **Landslides:**  Heavy shaking triggers landslides in the Hollywood Hills and other hillside areas, damaging homes and blocking roads.\n",
       "*   **Tsunami Threat:**  While the epicenter is inland, there is a concern about potential landslides into the ocean triggering localized tsunamis.  Coastal areas are put on alert.\n",
       "*   **Economic Impact:**  The earthquake causes billions of dollars in damage.  Businesses are disrupted, and the tourism industry suffers a major blow.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Challenges:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **High Population Density:**  The high population density of Los Angeles makes rescue and relief efforts extremely challenging.\n",
       "*   **Infrastructure Vulnerability:**  The aging infrastructure of Los Angeles is particularly vulnerable to earthquakes.\n",
       "*   **Communication Breakdown:**  Communication systems are overwhelmed, making it difficult to coordinate rescue and relief efforts.\n",
       "*   **Resource Scarcity:**  Resources such as water, food, and medical supplies are quickly depleted.\n",
       "*   **Public Health Concerns:**  Concerns about the spread of disease due to water contamination and overcrowding in shelters.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Potential Escalation:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Major Aftershock:**  A large aftershock could cause further collapses and increase casualties.\n",
       "*   **Widespread Civil Unrest:**  If looting and civil unrest escalate, it could overwhelm law enforcement and hinder rescue efforts.\n",
       "*   **Long-Term Displacement:**  Thousands of people could be permanently displaced from their homes, creating a long-term housing crisis.\n",

    "2. **Relevance and Usefulness**: The response provides relevant insights or actions that would be helpful in earthquake response, such as resource planning, risk zones, evacuation paths, or damage estimates.\n",
    "3. **Clarity and Structure**: The information is clearly presented and logically organized, allowing emergency teams or planners to understand and use it quickly.\n",
    "4. **Completeness**: The response addresses all aspects of the simulation request or scenario, without leaving critical details out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rating Rubric\n",
    "5: (Excellent). Fully accurate, highly relevant, clearly written, and complete.\n",
    "4: (Good). Mostly accurate and relevant, clearly written, but may miss one minor detail.\n",
    "3: (Fair). Partially accurate or relevant; some gaps in clarity or completeness.\n",

       "**Scenario: Los Angeles Earthquake**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Location:** Los Angeles, California, USA\n",
       "*   **Magnitude:** 6.8\n",
       "*   **Population Density:** High (especially in affected areas)\n",
       "*   **Time:** 03:45 AM (Pacific Standard Time)\n",
       "*   **Date:** October 26, 2024\n",
       "\n",
       "**Initial Situation Report:**\n",
       "\n",
       "**The Event:** At 03:45 AM PST, a magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The epicenter is located approximately 10 miles (16 km) southwest of downtown Los Angeles, near Inglewood. The shallow depth of the quake (estimated at 7 miles/11 km) amplified the shaking intensity.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Immediate Impacts:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Widespread Shaking:** Strong to very strong shaking (MMI VII-VIII) was felt across Los Angeles County, Orange County, and parts of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties.\n",
       "*   **Infrastructure Damage:**\n",
       "    *   **Transportation:** Reports of collapsed overpasses on major freeways (I-10, I-405) near the epicenter. Significant damage to surface streets, including cracks, buckling, and sinkholes. Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) reports runway damage and is temporarily closed.\n",
       "    *   **Utilities:** Widespread power outages across the region. Natural gas leaks reported in multiple locations, leading to fires. Water main breaks are causing flooding in some areas. Cell phone service is disrupted due to overloaded networks and damaged infrastructure.\n",
       "    *   **Buildings:** Older, unreinforced masonry buildings in downtown Los Angeles and older residential areas have suffered significant damage or collapse. Newer buildings, while generally structurally sound, have experienced non-structural damage (broken windows, fallen debris).\n",
       "*   **Casualties:** Initial reports indicate a high number of injuries and fatalities. Hospitals are overwhelmed with patients. Search and rescue operations are underway to locate trapped individuals in collapsed buildings.\n",
       "*   **Population Displacement:** Thousands of people are displaced from their homes due to damage or fear of aftershocks. Emergency shelters are being set up in schools, community centers, and parks.\n",
       "*   **Emergency Services:** Fire departments, police, and paramedics are stretched thin responding to calls for help. Communication difficulties are hampering coordination efforts.\n",
       "*   **Aftershocks:** Numerous aftershocks are being felt, including several above magnitude 4.0, causing further panic and hindering rescue efforts.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Challenges:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Search and Rescue:** Accessing and rescuing trapped individuals in collapsed buildings is the top priority. Specialized urban search and rescue teams are needed.\n",
       "*   **Medical Surge Capacity:** Hospitals are overwhelmed. Triage and medical care are needed at the scene of collapses and in temporary shelters.\n",
       "*   **Shelter and Basic Needs:** Providing shelter, food, water, and sanitation to displaced populations is critical.\n",
       "*   **Communication:** Restoring communication networks is essential for coordinating the response.\n",
       "*   **Traffic Congestion:** Damaged roads and freeways are causing massive traffic jams, hindering emergency vehicle access.\n",
       "*   **Fire Suppression:** Controlling fires caused by natural gas leaks is a major concern.\n",
       "*   **Public Panic:** Fear and anxiety are widespread, leading to panic and hindering orderly evacuation.\n",
       "*   **Resource Allocation:** Prioritizing and allocating limited resources (personnel, equipment, supplies) effectively is crucial.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Potential Escalation Factors:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Major Aftershock:** A large aftershock could cause further building collapses and casualties.\n",
       "*   **Tsunami Threat:** Although the epicenter is inland, a large earthquake could trigger a local tsunami, impacting coastal areas.\n",
       "*   **Hazardous Materials Release:** Damage to industrial facilities could lead to the release of hazardous materials.\n",
       "*   **Civil Unrest:** As resources become scarce, there is a risk of looting and civil unrest.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Immediate Actions Required:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Activate Emergency Operations Center (EOC):** Coordinate the response efforts of all agencies.\n",
       "2.  **Deploy Search and Rescue Teams:** Focus on areas with collapsed buildings.\n",
       "3.  **Establish Medical Triage Centers:** Set up temporary medical facilities to treat the injured.\n",
       "4.  **Open Emergency Shelters:** Provide shelter and basic needs to displaced populations.\n",
       "5.  **Restore Communication Networks:** Prioritize restoring communication for emergency responders and the public.\n",
       "6.  **Assess Infrastructure Damage:** Conduct a rapid assessment of damage to critical infrastructure.\n",
       "7.  **Request Mutual Aid:** Request assistance from neighboring jurisdictions and state/federal agencies.\n",
       "8.  **Issue Public Safety Announcements:** Provide clear and accurate information to the public about the situation and safety precautions.\n",

B highlights specific areas of concern, such as Downtown Los Angeles, Hollywood, and low-income communities, making the simulation more targeted. The inclusion of possible escalation factors adds depth. It also offers relevant questions to consider for simulation, which could prompt deeper analysis.\n",

    "## Future Work\n",
    "- Enhance the file upload feature to allow users to upload various disaster-related documents, enabling the generation of crisis response plans beyond the 2025 Myanmar Earthquake scenario—making the tool adaptable to any disaster context.\n",
    "- Extend the generate_response_plan_rag(user_query) function to also support response plan generation based on simulated disaster scenarios created in Section 1, together with social media simulation in Section 3 as part of inputs.\n",
    "- Introduce user role selection (e.g., policymaker, field responder, NGO planner) with a simple UI, so the generated plan can be tailored based on the role's perspective and needs.\n",
    "- Experiment with alternative prompting strategies and few-shot examples to further improve response relevance, accuracy, and structure.\n",
    "- Integrate GenAI evaluation techniques to automatically assess the quality and usefulness of the generated plans based on predefined criteria.\n",
    "- Set up continuous evaluation and improvement pipelines using MLOps tools to monitor performance, update embeddings, and track document relevance over time.\n",
    "- (Will be interesting to have) Generate visual displays like interactive response timelines or affected regions."
